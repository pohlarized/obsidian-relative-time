# RFC 3339 Relative Time

This is a simple plugin that displays RFC 3339 timestamps within inline codeblocks as relative timestamps.

## Usage

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is forked from the [Obsidian Sample Plugin].
It leverages [`@github/relative-time-element`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/relative-time-element) for formatting datetimes.
The plugin was mostly vibe-coded with some minor manual fixes using google gemini 2.5 pro preview.
